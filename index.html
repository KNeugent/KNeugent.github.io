<h1 style="text-align:center">Dr. Kathryn Neugent</h1>

<p>Welcome! Here are five fun facts about me:
  <ol>
    <li>I'm a senior data scientist at <a href="https://www.cablelabs.com">CableLabs</a> in Louisville, Colorado where I spend my time attempting to understand user behavior on the internet.</li>
    <li>Up until July 2023, I was a NASA Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow and my research focused on massive stars. From my astronomy days, I have an asteroid named after me! Watch (165192) Neugent move <a href="/assets/img/Neugent165192.gif">here</a> and <a href="/assets/img/NeugentAsteroid.gif">here.</a></li>
    <li>One of my life goals is to hike to all of the lakes in Rocky Mountain National Park. Track my progress (and photos!) <a href="https://kathrynneugent.com/RMNP_Lakes/">here!</a></li>
    <li>I'm really good at collecting new hobbies. My current favorites include: hiking, backpacking, landscape photography, knitting, crocheting, weight lifting, cycling (spinning), watching Colorado Avalanche games with my husband <a href="https://www.garrettneugent.com">Garrett</a>, and learning way too much about the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/katm/planyourvisit/bear-watching.htm">bears of Katmai</a>. I'd also love to get back into playing piano, singing in a choir, and fostering cats.</li>
    <li>And last but very much not least, I'm passionate about advocating for disability rights and destigmatizing mental health discussions.</li>
  </ol>
