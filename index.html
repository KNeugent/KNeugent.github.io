<h1 style="text-align:center">Dr. Kathryn Neugent</h1>

<p>I'm an astronomer (recently) turned data scientist who enjoys cuddling with my cat, <a href="/assets/img/Andy.jpg">Andy</a> and <a href="/assets/img/jumping.jpg">hiking</a> with my husband, <a href="https://www.garrettneugent.com/about/">Garrett</a>!</p>

<p> To learn more about me and what I've been up to, please take a look around!</p>

<p>Five fun facts about me:
  <ol>
    <li>I have an asteroid named after me! Watch (165192) Neugent move <a href="/assets/img/Neugent165192.gif">here</a> and <a href="/assets/img/NeugentAsteroid.gif">here.</a></li>
    <li>I'm on the board of an amazing cat rescue organization in Colorado Springs called <a href="https://lookwhatthecatbroughtin.org">Look What The Cat Brought In</a> and Garrett and I adopted Andy from there in 2022.</li>
    <li>One of my life goals is to hike to all of the state high-points. I've currently only done 3.5/50 (Arizona, Colorado, Virginia, and almost Hawaii!), but I (hopefully) have many more hiking years ahead of me!</li>
    <li>I have too many hobbies than I have time for including: hiking, backpacking, photography, knitting, crocheting, weight lifting, cycling (spinning), baking, and learning way too much about the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/katm/planyourvisit/bear-watching.htm">bears of Katmai</a>. I'd also love to get back into playing piano, singing in a choir, and fostering cats.</li>
    <li>And last but very much not least, I'm passionate about advocating for disability rights and destigmatizing discussing mental health in academia and the workplace.</li>
