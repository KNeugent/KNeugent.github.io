I study the evolution of massive stars as a NASA Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University.

In my spare time, you can find me cuddled up with my dog, [Meg](https://KNeugent.github.io/assets/img/Meg.jpg), my cat, [Andy](https://KNeugent.github.io/assets/img/Andy.jpg), or [hiking in Colorado](https://KNeugent.github.io/assets/img/jumping.jpg) with my husband, [Garrett](https://www.garrettneugent.com/about/).

Fun fact: I have an asteroid named after me!
Watch (165192) Neugent move [here](https://KNeugent.github.io/assets/img/Neugent165192.gif) and [here](https://KNeugent.github.io/assets/img/NeugentAsteroid.gif).
