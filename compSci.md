While astronomy research has been my main focus since 2015, I have an undergraduate and Master's degree in computer science and spent a few years working in the field of cyber security. Here I briefly summarize a few of my more recent astronomy-focused programming projects as well as my an overview of my experience working in cyber security.

# Astronomy-focused programming projects

## Identifying red supergiant binary systems using a k-Nearest Neighbor classifier

[github link to code](https://github.com/KNeugent/kNN-BinaryStars)

As part of my PhD thesis at the University of Washington, I observationally constrained the binary fraction of red supergiants in the Local Group galaxies of M31, M33, and the Magellanic Clouds. While I discuss the science motivation more [here](https://kathrynneugent.com/astronomy/), one of my favorite parts of this research was building a k-NN classifier using Python's `sklearn` to photometrically differentiate between the single and binary red supergiants. The code and a more detailed explanation can be [found on github](https://github.com/KNeugent/kNN-BinaryStars).
