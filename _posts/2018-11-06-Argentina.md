I recently travelled to Bariloche, Argentina to give an invited talk on "Surveys and Properties of Wolf-Rayet Stars" at NidiaFest, a conference in honor of the 65th birthday of Nidia Morrell. I've observed with Nidia many times at Las Campañas and consider her one of my closest collaborators.

Before the conference, ten of us (including Phil and Nidia) travelled across the Andes. We flew into Temuco, Chile before crossing the Chilean-Argentinian boarder and spending a night in San Martín de los Andes, Argentina. Finally we arrived in Bariloche to begin the conference. On the way we saw beautiful lakes, waterfalls, and the Volcán Lanín along the Pan-American highway.
