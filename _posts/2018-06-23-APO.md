In late June I went down to New Mexico to do a training run on the 3.5m at Apache Point Observatory. For three nights I took spectra of red supergiants with the hopes of finding binary companions. While my science wasn't incredibly successful, we made up for it by putting an eyepiece on the telescope to look at the Ring Nebula, M13, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars and the Moon. Now that I'm trained I can observe remotely from UW but I'll be back next year as part of the UW observing class.
