My collaborators and I have a paper in press on a runaway Yellow Supergiant star in the Small Magellanic Cloud (see [here](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180302859N)). We found a 200 solar radii star hurdling its way through space at 300,000 miles / hour! Because this is pretty cool, we issued a [press release](https://lowell.edu/runaway-star/) describing our discovery. I did an interview with the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/news/2018/03/29/stellar-break-up-likely-behind-runaway-stars-fast-pace-researcher-says/?menu2=http://www.washington.edu/news/category/profiles/) and it has since been picked up by quite a few sources including [I Freaking Love Science](http://www.iflscience.com/space/a-rare-type-of-runaway-star-has-been-seen-speeding-through-another-galaxy/), [Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/rare-runaway-supergiant-star-discovered-speeding-across-neighboring-galaxy-864578), [Sky & Telescope](http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/supergiant-star-caught-fleeing-through-another-galaxy/), [Phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2018-03-runaway-star-small-magellanic-cloud.html), and [EarthSky.org](http://earthsky.org/space/runaway-star-j01020100-7122208-small-magellanic-cloud). I was even [interviewed for a podcast](https://astrophiz.wordpress.com/2018/04/10/next-up-astrophiz-55-kathryn-neugent-runaway-yellow-supergiant/)!

Now for a follow-up note from Kathryn in the future ...

This star turned out *not* to be a runaway yellow supergiant, but actually something much more interesting! Take a look at this video to learn more (it starts around 5 minutes in).
