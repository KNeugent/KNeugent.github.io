Pretty soon I'll be packing my bags to head back to Europe for another astronomy conference. After Greece in 2013, and Switzerland in 2014, Phil and I are now headed off to Potsdam, Germany for a conference on Wolf-Rayet stars! Phil will be giving an invited talk on Wolf-Rayet surveys and I'll be giving a talk on our newly discovered WN3/O3 stars and how I've been using CMFGEN to characterize their physical parameters.

Additionally, I decided to take advantage of the free round-trip airfare and extend my stay by a week. Before the conference I'll be playing tourist in Innsbruck and Salzburg, Austria as well as a short trip to Munich, Germany. Should be fun and exciting!
