I'm thrilled to announce that I've accepted a postdoc position at the University of Toronto as a Dunlap Fellow with a tentative start date of September 1, 2021! Once we're vaccinated, Garrett and I (and Meg and Marlowe) will be moving to Toronto, Canada for a few years while I explore more massive star research. While I'm a little apprehensive about the lack of nearby mountains, I'm excited for this new opportunity and chance to interact with new collaborators and research ideas.
