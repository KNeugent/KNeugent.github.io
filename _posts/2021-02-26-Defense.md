On the morning of February 25th, 2021, I successfully defended my PhD dissertation entitled, "The Binary Fraction of Red Supergiants" based on my work done at the University of Washington with advisor Dr. Emily Levesque over the past three and a half years. I was initially nervous and a little disappointed that I would have to defend over Zoom as opposed to in-person, but it ended up being a wonderful experience. Friends and family from all parts of my life were able to join virtually both to watch my defense as well as celebrate with me after. Next up I have a few corrections to make to my written dissertation before I submit the final copy, but at that point I'll be the first person in my extended family to earn their PhD!
