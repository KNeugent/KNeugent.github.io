In the end of November I journeyed to Auckland, New Zealand to present my work at a Massive Stars conference. In addition to the conference, I also did a little vacationing before hand. My friend and I visited Hobbiton, Rotorua, Taupo, and Hot Water beach. Hopefully the next Massive Star "beach meeting" is in an exciting location!
