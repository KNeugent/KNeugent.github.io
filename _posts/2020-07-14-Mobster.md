This week I attended my first entirely virtual conference! It was put on by the MOBSTER collaboration and focused mainly on stellar variability and magnetic fields of massive stars ([conference website](https://sites.google.com/view/mobster1vc/home?authuser=0)). I was invited to give a contributed talk on Binary Red Supergiants which had very little to do with either stellar variability or magnetic fields ... oops!

The format of the conference was interesting, though. The talks were pre-recorded and then played over a live Zoom session. At the end of each talk, participants would ask questions on a slack channel and then the presenter could answer them in real time. It seemed to work pretty well! The only issue was that, in order to include participants in all time zones, the conference was from 5:30 am - noon ... so basically the middle of the night for me.

If you'd like to take a look at my talk, it has been put up on YouTube! Hopefully the paper will be out soon!
