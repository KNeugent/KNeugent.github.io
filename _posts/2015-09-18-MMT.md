Even though I'm now a NAU grad student doing my masters thesis on asteroids, I'm continuing my massive star research with Phil Massey. One of the upsides of this collaboration is that I still get to tag along on observing runs. Tonight we're observing Wolf-Rayet binaries at the MMT down near Tucson, AZ. The last 19 nights have been clouded / rained out but apparently I brought some good luck -- Phil and I have clear skies and 0.4" seeing! This observing run has also been a great opportunity to test out my new camera. Right after astronomical twilight, I went outside, pointed it at Sagittarius and took the image above.
