On August 8, 2022 (8/8/22!), Garrett and I got married! We went for a beautiful hike up Flattop Mountain and to the base of Hallett Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park and said our vows among the marmots, pika, and ptarmigan. We then hiked down and signed the official paperwork at our home in Lafayette. It was perfect in every way!
