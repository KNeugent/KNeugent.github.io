In mid-September Phil and I made a short trip to the MMT for one night of observing on Hectospec. Sadly the guider didn't work and we didn't get any data (with sub-arcsecond seeing!!), but Hectospec operates in queue mode so we weren't totally out of luck. In fact, the night after we left one of our fields was observed. I just finished up a methods paper detailing how to photometrically detect red supergiant + b star binaries and these observations confirmed that my method worked! Pretty exciting ... and now time for a new paper!
