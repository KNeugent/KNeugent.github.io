In early June I traveled toÂ Chicheley Hall in the English countryside to present my work on WN3/O3 Wolf-Rayets at the Bridging the gap: from massive stars to supernovae meeting. In addition to learning more about these stars from an evolutionary standpoint, I additionally got the chance to do some traveling! I extended my trip by a bit and visited Stonehenge before heading on over to Scandinavia. There I saw the Norwegian fjords as well as Oslo, Stockholm, Uppsala, and Copenhagen.
