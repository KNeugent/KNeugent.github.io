In mid-October Phil Massey and I went to Hawaii to observe on 8-m Gemini North as priority visitors. This meant we acted like queue observers in exchange for getting the chance to observe our own Wolf-Rayets under pristine Mauna Kea conditions. Sadly, these conditions never occurred but I still got to see volcanos, sea turtles, and really big telescopes on the top of Mauna Kea.
