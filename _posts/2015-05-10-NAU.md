This August I'll be moving back to Flagstaff, AZ to attend Northern Arizona University and work towards my Masters in Applied Physics with asteroid-extraordinaire David Trilling as my advisor. While I've enjoyed researching massive stars for the past 6 years, it will be fun to focus my research on asteroids again! And, I hear there's a massive star meeting in New Zealand coming up in 2016 so I don't think I'll totally abandon my massive star research ...
