I'm happy to announce that I was selected as one of this year's NASA Hubble Postdoctoral Fellows and will be starting at Harvard University in Fall 2022! I've additionally accepted the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's Center for Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship and will combine that with the Hubble for 5 years of postdoctoral experience at the CfA! Moving plans are still TBD, but I'm excited for this next step in my career!

Here's the [official announcement](https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2022/news-2022-022) and here's a [link to my bio](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program/2022-nhfp-fellows#section-50906a13-d10e-49fe-b8ae-77a6aff0cdf7).
