I recently returned from a trip to Las Campanas Observatory where my collaborators and I finished up a four year project searching for Wolf-Rayet stars in the Magellanic Clouds using the 1-meter Swope telescope. We have a few half nights on the Baade Magellan telescope in less than a month to hopefully confirm any candidate Wolf-Rayets we may have found as part of this survey. So far we've found around a dozen new Wolf-Rayet stars as well as an entirely new class of Wolf-Rayet stars. So, I'd say the survey has been pretty successful!
